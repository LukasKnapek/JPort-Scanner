# January - Port Scanner
*This application is no longer in development.*

This is a simple Python port scanner that allows users to scan a given host for open/closed ports in any range.
This scanner utilizes basic threading to decrease the scan time dramatically.

NOTE: Port scanning might be forbidden in your network or by your ISP. Please check before you use the program.
